## Prerequisites

These instructions assume that you have implemented and deployed the Citizen Engagement API as described in [this article](http://www.iflux.io/use-case/2015/02/03/citizen-engagement.html) and [this course repository](https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-CM_WEBS-2016).

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.
The latest LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended (v4.4.2 at the time of writing these instructions).
The Ionic documentation currently indicates that versions v5.x.x are not supported.

<a name="ui"></a>
## 1. User Interface

We have created a design for our app available [here](https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_JGHaMwhypEvFRJXSJF2ELBFvhTuCJ7iW.1459774779362)
with [Fluid UI](https://www.fluidui.com).

![UI Design](www/img/readMe/fluid.PNG)

We have created a sandwich menu with different pannels (some changes have been made in the final app)

* the home tab
* the new issue tab;
* the issue map tab;
* the issue list tab:
  * the issue details screen doesn't appear on the side menu but when you click on a thumbnail

### Login

You can enter your first and last name. If you do not exist in the database, this will create a new account.
You then have to select if you want to view the app as a citizen or staff (this feature will come soon).

You can also create a new staff if you're a staff yourself (coming soon as well).
