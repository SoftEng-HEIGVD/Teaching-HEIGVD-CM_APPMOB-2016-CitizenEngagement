# FixYourStreet-Frontend

COMEM Application mobile 2016 Project

The project FixYourStreet-Frontend is a continuation of the course of Web service. The goal of this second part is to provide an interface and functionalities for the mobile application Citizen engagement. To develop this part, it was possible to either use the api we developed in the previous course or use one which is provided by the teacher. We choose the second option.
