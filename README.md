<a name="ui"></a>
## 1. User Interface

We have created a design for our app available [here](https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_JGHaMwhypEvFRJXSJF2ELBFvhTuCJ7iW.1459774779362)
with [Fluid UI](https://www.fluidui.com).

We have created a sandwich menu with different pannels (some changes have been made in the final app)

* the home tab
* the new issue tab;
* the issue map tab;
* the issue list tab:
  * the issue details screen doesn't appear on the side menu but when you click on a thumbnail

## 2. Using the application



<a name="setup-fork"></a>
### Login
![UI login](www/img/readMe/login.png =250x)
You can enter your first and last name. If you do not exist in the database, this will create a new account.
You then have to select if you want to view the app as a citizen or staff (this feature will come soon).

You can also create a new staff if you're a staff yourself (coming soon as well).
